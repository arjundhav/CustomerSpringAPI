Step1: Create a Spring Boot project: Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project. Add the necessary dependencies for building REST APIs, such as Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.

Step2: Define the model: Create a Java class to represent the resource you want to manage. This class should have the necessary attributes and methods to store and manipulate data.

Step3: Define the repository: Create a Spring Data JPA repository interface to define the CRUD operations for the model class. This interface should extend the JpaRepository interface.

Step4: Define the controller: Create a Spring MVC controller class to handle incoming HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The controller class should use the repository to retrieve and manipulate data.

Step5: Implement the API endpoints: Implement the methods in the controller class to handle the HTTP requests for the API endpoints. These methods should map to the appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and use the repository to interact with the data.

Step6: Test the API: Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints and ensure that the CRUD operations are working as expected.

Step7: Add security: Depending on the application, you may need to add security to the API using Spring Security or another authentication and authorization framework.

Step8: Deploy the API: Deploy the API to a production environment, such as a cloud platform or on-premises server, and configure it for performance and scalability.
